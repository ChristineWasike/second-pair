  <h2>describing my favourite thing</h2>
  <p1>music takes me to a different world.
     It is a language that connects me to different musicians both far and near.
     I play an instrument called the clarinet which helps me share this music.</p1>
     <p2>food is good.
       It's what makes as healthy and keeps us alive.
       I love eating food.</p2>
       <p3>chess is an amazing board game.
         It is based on critical thinking and strategy.
         I often play it with my father and brother.</p3>
